      <p>
        Vanilla JS Academy is a project-based online JavaScript training program
        run by Chris Ferdinandi.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first started learning how to code with React so I wanted to go back
        to basics and see how good I was at Vanilla JS.
      </p>

      <p>Here's a testimonial I left on the training program's page:</p>

      <p>
        "I'm loving the Academy and I don't want it to end! For me this is
        priceless. I don't work in tech yet and to be able to do those mini
        projects and discuss the code and best practices with you guys is a
        great learning experience. The pace of the course is nice too because it
        keeps me busy and that helps me feel more comfortable with the syntax
        and methods."
      </p>

      <p>
        This course helped me get over my imposter syndrome back then. I've
        managed to get all the challenges done and solved all the technical
        problems. It was very rewarding to me that my code and logic behind it
        was just as clean and good as my peers' solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earlier this year I enrolled in the January 2022 session of Advanced JS:
        Structure & Scale but I still haven't found the time to go through it.
      </p>
