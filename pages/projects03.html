      <p>Built with Ruby on Rails.</p>
      <p>
        At first I just wanted to do a sort of bulletin board for the coliving
        space I'm living in but I've enjoyed so much playing around with RoR
        that I've kept going and adding new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step would be to show the project to our community manager so it
        can finally go "live" and then I want to do some iteration based on user
        feedback.
