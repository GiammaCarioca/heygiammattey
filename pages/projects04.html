    <main>
      <p>A free REST API for Rihanna quotes.</p>
      <p>
        The project was inspired by the Kanye West API by Andrew Jazbec and the
        Ron Swanson Quotes API by James Wright.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fenty is always serving! Not only looks and bops but also wisdom! I
        wanted to bring more diversity to the API world. I was tired of using
        the same old quote APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For building the API I've used Node.js, Express.js and TypeScript. I
        could've gone serverless but I took it as an opportunity to learn more
        about backend stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        For webscrapping the quotes I've wrote a Python script using the
        Beautiful Soup library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though it's just a fun little project I'm already thinking about
        adding new features for v2 and building other projects consuming the
        very same API.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way I've already built an Alexa skill with Node.js that consumes
        this API to serve Rihanna quotes but I haven't deployed yet (coming
        soon!).
      </p>
      <p>The API is hosted on Heroku.</p>
