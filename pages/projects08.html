      I.ED is an editorial-based content for postgraduate students at the
      European Institute of Design IED in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
    </p>

    <p>
      IED is an international design school known for its “learning-by-doing”
      educational approach with professionals from the design industry
      teaching their practices to the students.
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      How a digital product can improve the learning experience of
      postgraduate students at IED Rio de Janeiro?
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided to start with a quality research with user interviews within
      the university. The aim was to better understand who were the students
      of IED Rio. In particular, how they behaved in the learning process and
      how they related to digital tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome was that nearly all students had a great lack of time in
      deepening their studies and knowledge outside the classes. They
      preferred to study by online readings, appreciating the flexibility and
      the possibility to study whenever and wherever they wanted and could.
      Generally, there was a lack in theoretical knowledge and orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help us to create greater empathy with users, and come up with
      features for the app, we defined two personas based on student responses
      to our questionnaire. In order to understand the market trends that
      would be relevant to develop our product, we made a further research
      about the existing and upcoming educational digital products. Loads of
      sketches, wireframes and user testing were made, along with a session of
      card sorting to come up with a site map that corresponded to user
      expectations.
    </p>
    <h3>The result</h3>
    <p>
      In a hybrid learning context, which comprised a phase in an online
      environment, focused on content, and a face-to-face phase, our digital
      product fits exactly into the online phase. A key point of our MVP was
      to eliminate (or at least reduce) the dispersion, distraction and lack
      of time that users encountered when trying to accomplish the key task of
      studying by reading online content.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, we presented an application with a minimal interface that
      follows IED’s brand guidelines with a progressive disclosure of few
      daily curated and personalized content relevant to the student’s course.
