  <h1>Hey, SuperHi!</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Thiago but they also call me Giamma. I've been a teacher my
    whole life. That's what I do best. That's what I'm known for. I teach
    Italian by the way even though I'm not Italian but Brazilian. When I'm in
    the classroom, that's the best version of myself. I'm king of my world. I
    own the room. Suddenly I'm not shy anymore. I'm confident, lots of fun, I
    project my voice and my soul. It's like a whole new person.
  </p>

  <p>
    Giamma is a persona. Giamma is cool and all but I want Thiago to be the
    best version of myself. I want to incorporate the best traits of Giamma
    into my core. I don't want to have to rely on a persona to be what I want
    to be. I'm not my job. Even though I love what I do. A dear student of
    mine once said to me: "You're lucky because you do what you love and you
    love what you do." That's a privilege that I don't take for granted. At
    all. So now that I'm transitioning into a new career I want to take that
    love with me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can totally see why Giamma took over though. Thiago is a dreamer. An
    introvert. Afraid of what people might say. Actually being around people
    can be very draining for him. Giamma's got his back! He is encouraging and
    he gets the best out of Thiago. Sometimes he might unveil Thiago's secrets
    and even make fun of his fears but Thiago doesn't mind. He's got a sense
    of humor. You see, Giamma has all that good parts of Thiago but the
    opposite may not be true. Things are changing though. Since Thiago came
    out to his family (it only took him 36 years and a homophobic president)
    he's been trying to break the mold. Even if he's not sure that's possible
    because when you've spent your whole life not being able to be who you
    really are, when you've been forged from fear and rejection, that's like
    trying to access Earth's inner core! Either way Thiago is trying to figure
    it all out, trying to figure his way out. I know for a fact he's eager and
    willing to take over from here.
  </p>

    Back in 2016 I (Thiago, Giamma... "I'm one, none and a hundred thousand" -
    Pirandello) embarked on a new journey, a specialization in Digital
    Projects. I wanted to build digital products to help people to learn
    Italian. I was not a designer back then. I used to think designer meant
    graphic designer so I've learned a great deal during that course:
    Research, Design Thinking, UX, UI. It was not a in deep course but
    everything was new for me so it was worthy. Having said that, by the end
    of the specialization I was still not able to build the projects I wanted
    to build (spoiler alert: to this day I'm still learning things to build
    what I have in mind). Prototyping is nice and all but I wanted to build
    the real thing so I've decided to learn how to code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here we go again on another journey! In 2018 I didn't know much about
    programming. I wasn't even sure it was for me. I could not afford a
    graduate course or a bootcamp because I was broke. I had spent all my
    savings on that specialization. The solution was to "teach myself" how to
    code. That's when SuperHi came into my life. I stepped into the
    programming world for a purpose, not for a job or for a higher pay. My
    current job allows me to have the luxury to study and learn the things and
    technologies that I'm interested in, in my own time. I haven't exactly
    been preparing myself for a job (hunt). I know I could've found a tech job
    already (had I sticked to a more specific learning path say front-end web
    development) but I don't want to compromise. I'm almost 40 years old,
    switching careers, it's important for me to work with something I believe
    in and that will help foster my dreams. I don't want to work for a fintech
    or pharmaceutical company for example. That choice comes with a price.
  </p>

  <p>
    Either way I've learned lots of stuff in a couple of years and despite my
    imposter syndrome I had finally started looking for a tech job when the
    pandemic hit. I had done two job interviews just a week before the first
    lockdown here. My life has completely changed since then and unfortunately
    I could not focus on coding for almost a year. The imposter syndrome came
    in full swing again. Only since last October I began to code again and now
    I've decided to look for a job as a developer again. I've been trying to
    get some projects done/polished to build my portfolio. I'm still working
    on rebuilding my site, have some documentation to do. I'm a generalist, I
    love learning new things and I have genuine interest in almost all things
    tech related. Lately I've been digging more into backend for example but I
    know that's not smart if my short term goal is to land a job. I should
    focus on a more narrow stack for now.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the last months in order to get my mojo back I build a RESTful API,
    worked on an Alexa skill consuming that API, went all the way to learn
    NestJS to do my first open source contribution, turned to Rails for a full
    stack project, started learning about testing. Now I want to focus on
    improving my skills in React/NextJS and TypeScript, learn more about
    Testing, GraphQL and databases. And I have yet to finish my new website
    using 11ty. All while looking for a job, which is a full-time job in
    itself. That's why Giamma has to go. Giamma walked so Thiago can finally
    run and I've got a marathon ahead of me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Me, Giamma and code. Giamma works so I can code. Giamma pays the bills,
    the online courses in dollar. When Giamma is not working, Thiago is
    coding. This deal between Giamma and me has worked well for the two of us
    but now I'm afraid it's just not sustainable anymore. The thing is we
    share the same body so I get frustrated every time I'm in the flow coding
    and Giamma has to go to work. Remember the "you do what you love and you
    love what you do" motto? It's not like that anymore I'm afraid. Thiago
    needs time to focus on his projects and Giamma is getting in the way. I
    don't want to resent Giamma so I have to send him into retirement. First I
    have to land a job though and getting to work at SuperHi would feel like
    getting my first job ever!
